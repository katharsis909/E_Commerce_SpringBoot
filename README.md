#Mini E-Commerce

Built a Spring Boot RESTful service for product management (view, order, add).

Secured endpoints with JWT-based authentication & authorization.

Implemented optimistic locking to ensure consistency under concurrent orders.

Integrated pagination to deliver products in manageable pages.

Applied the Proxy Design Pattern to lazily retrieve full product details only upon request.
